            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In the early 2010s, a friend of mine built a thriving business selling office chairs on Amazon. 
              He became one of the platform's largest sellers, with thousands of happy customers and steady growth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Then Amazon struck. They traced his supply chain, sourced the same chairs from his manufacturer, 
              and launched them under Amazon Basics at a price lower than his cost. Overnight, his business 
              disappeared. Years of work, customer trust, and expertise were wiped out by a platform that 
              could copy what worked and crush the original creator.
            </p>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This is not just his story. It is the story of commerce today, where platforms hold the power 
              and businesses fight to survive inside systems designed to extract more than they give.

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-semibold mb-4 font-instrument-serif">Marketplace Feudalism</h2>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Modern marketplaces create a kind of digital feudalism. Independent businesses compete 
              desperately against one another while the platforms they depend on face no real competition 
              at all. Sellers cannot simply move. Shifting from Amazon to eBay or from Shopify to another 
              provider means starting over, losing reviews, retraining algorithms, and abandoning years 
              of optimization.
            </p>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The result is an ecosystem where rules change overnight, fees rise without warning, and even 
              your best ideas can be copied by the very platform you rely on. Businesses look like owners 
              but operate more like tenants, paying rent in the form of data, fees, and dependence.

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-semibold mb-4 font-instrument-serif">Building a Decentralized Marketplace</h2>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              At Openship, we are creating open source software as a service platforms for every vertical, 
              from hotels to grocery stores to barbershops. Together, these vertical platforms form the 
              foundation of a decentralized marketplace, where businesses fully own their storefronts and 
              customer relationships.
            </p>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Instead of bending to centralized platforms, businesses can participate in a network where 
              each store remains independent but interoperable. Instead of adapting your business to fit 
              marketplace requirements, you flip the script: marketplaces adapt to you. Your store becomes 
              the single source of truth, syncing automatically across every channel while you maintain 
              complete control. The more businesses that join, the stronger the network becomes, without a 
              single gatekeeper deciding who succeeds or fails.

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-semibold mb-4 font-instrument-serif">Software That Fits Your Business</h2>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For too long, businesses shaped themselves around rigid, one size fits all software. They 
              spent countless hours configuring dashboards and workarounds, trying to fit unique needs 
              into generic molds. That era is ending.
            </p>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Modern development makes it possible to create personal software, tools that adapt to the 
              business rather than the other way around. This is not about turning everyone into developers. 
              It is about making commerce infrastructure flexible enough that businesses can shape it to 
              their exact needs. Instead of clicking through endless dashboards, you can simply tell your 
              AI assistant what you need: "Create a product for the European market" or "Route this order 
              to our best supplier."
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-4xl font-semibold mb-4 font-instrument-serif">Built for Independence</h2>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This is why we built infrastructure that you can truly own. With Openship and Openfront, 
              your store is your system, your code, your data. If we disappear tomorrow, your business 
              keeps running because the tools are open and under your control.
            </p>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Ownership means freedom. Freedom to modify, freedom to expand, freedom to evolve without 
              permission. It also means security, knowing that no one can change the rules on you, raise 
              fees, or take your customers away. Every platform includes a built-in AI assistant that 
              understands your business completely, and because you own the platform, you have the choice
              to use our built-in assistant, Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI that can connect to MCP servers.

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-semibold mb-4 font-instrument-serif">The Path Forward</h2>
            <p className="text-fd-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The office chair story doesn't have to be yours. Deploy our platforms and flip the script: 
              instead of adapting your business to fit marketplace requirements, make marketplaces adapt 
              to you. Manage everything from your Openfront store while automatically syncing across every 
              channel. Build direct partnerships with other businesses through decentralized networks where 
              no middleman extracts fees or controls the relationship. Never again worry that a platform 
              will change the rules, raise fees, or copy your best ideas. Openfront and Openship: using open source to disrupt marketplaces.
