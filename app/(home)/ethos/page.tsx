                The Office Chair Empire That Wasn't
              </h2>

              <p className="text-justify">
                In the early 2010s, my friend built a thriving business selling
                office chairs on Amazon. He wasn't just another seller. He was
                one of the biggest office chair retailers on the platform, with
                thousands of satisfied customers and steady growth year after
                year.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify">Then Amazon struck.</p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                They tracked his supply chain, found his manufacturer in China,
                negotiated better terms than he could ever get, and launched the
                exact same chairs under Amazon Basics at 30% less than his cost.
                Overnight, his business evaporated. Years of
                relationship-building, customer reviews, and market knowledge
                were rendered worthless by a platform that could simply copy
                what worked and crush the original creator.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                This isn't a story about one unlucky seller. This is the story
                of commerce in 2025. A feudal system where individual businesses
                compete desperately with each other while the lords of the
                digital manor extract wealth from every transaction,
                relationship, and innovation.

                The Problem: Marketplace Feudalism
              </h2>

              <p className="text-justify">
                Today's commerce landscape has a fundamental imbalance.
                Individual businesses fight tooth and nail against each other, while
                the marketplaces they rely on face almost no competition at all.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify font-semibold">Sellers are trapped.</p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                Switching from Amazon to eBay means rebuilding your entire
                operation: losing your reviews, starting over with algorithms,
                and abandoning years of optimization. The marketplaces know
                this. They can raise fees, change rules overnight, and even copy
                your best products without consequence.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                The result is a commerce ecosystem designed to extract value from
                businesses rather than empower them. Sellers become more like
                franchisees than independent owners. Every transaction,
                every customer relationship, and every piece of data flows into
                someone else's empire while the actual creators
                of value struggle for scraps.

              <p className="text-justify">
                We're in the middle of a quiet revolution. For years, businesses

                tweaking endless settings and settling for "good enough."

                How Independent Businesses Become Powerful Networks
              </h2>

              <p className="text-justify">
                Most people think you have to choose: build a marketplace or build seller tools. 
                We do both, because when sellers truly own their infrastructure, marketplaces emerge organically from their networks.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify font-semibold">Here's how it works:</p>

              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Partner with Anyone</strong>. Connect your Openfront store directly with other 
                  independent businesses for inventory sharing, order routing, and fulfillment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Keep Your Profits</strong>. No marketplace takes a cut when you trade directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scale Without Risk</strong>. Expand into new markets by partnering with local 
                  fulfillment providers instead of building warehouses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Share the Upgrades</strong>. Open source means when one business adds a useful 
                  feature, everyone can benefit.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p className="text-justify">
                <strong>Example:</strong> You sell products in the US and want to expand to the UK. Instead of opening a warehouse and hiring staff, you partner with a UK fulfillment provider through Openship.
                Orders from UK customers are automatically routed to your partner for local delivery.
                You keep your customers, expand globally, and avoid massive infrastructure costs with zero marketplace fees.

                entire commerce infrastructure and the ability to modify it
