                The Office Chair Empire That Wasn't
              </h2>

              <p className="text-justify">
                In the early 2010s, my friend built a thriving business selling
                office chairs on Amazon. He wasn't just another seller. He was
                one of the biggest office chair retailers on the platform, with
                thousands of satisfied customers and steady growth year after
                year.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify">Then Amazon struck.</p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                They tracked his supply chain, found his manufacturer in China,
                negotiated better terms than he could ever get, and launched the
                exact same chairs under Amazon Basics at 30% less than his cost.
                Overnight, his business evaporated. Years of
                relationship-building, customer reviews, and market knowledge
                were rendered worthless by a platform that could simply copy
                what worked and crush the original creator.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                This isn't a story about one unlucky seller. This is the story
                of commerce in 2025: a feudal system where individual businesses
                compete desperately with each other while the lords of the
                digital manor extract wealth from every transaction,
                relationship, and innovation.
              </p>

                The Problem: Marketplace Feudalism
              </h2>

              <p className="text-justify">
                Today's commerce landscape has a fundamental imbalance.
                Individual businesses compete intensely with each other, while
                the marketplaces they rely on have captured the lion's share of
                market control.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify font-semibold">
                Sellers face brutal competition, but marketplaces have almost
                none.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify font-semibold">Sellers are trapped.</p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                Switching from Amazon to eBay means rebuilding your entire
                operation: losing your reviews, starting over with algorithms,
                and abandoning years of optimization. The marketplaces know
                this, so they can raise fees, change rules overnight, and copy
                your best products without consequence.
              </p>

              <p className="text-justify">
                The result? A commerce ecosystem designed to extract value from
                businesses rather than empower them. Sellers become more like
                franchisees than independent businesses. Every transaction,
                every customer relationship, every piece of data flows through
                and strengthens someone else's empire while the actual creators
                of value struggle for scraps.

                The Shift: Software That Fits Your Business

              <p className="text-justify">
                We're in the middle of a quiet revolution. For years, businesses

                by tweaking endless settings and accepting "good enough."
