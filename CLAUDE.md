2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up PostgreSQL database
4. Configure environment variables
5. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
6. Start development server: `npm run dev`
7. Access admin at `/dashboard` to create first user
8. Access storefront at `/`

### Available Scripts

- Inventory synchronization across channels
- Channel-specific pricing and availability

## Documentation Strategy

### Focus Areas
1. **Accurate Implementation Docs**: Document what actually works
2. **Real Examples**: Provide working code samples and API calls
3. **Setup Guides**: Step-by-step instructions that work
4. **Integration Guides**: How to connect real services
5. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Avoid
- Features not yet implemented
- Aspirational timelines
- Broken links and references
- Outdated information
- Placeholder content

## Next Steps for Documentation

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Update all GitHub repository URLs
2. Fix broken API explorer links
3. Create working GraphQL examples
4. Update feature comparison tables
5. Complete getting started guide

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. Document all 78+ data models
2. Create integration guides for Stripe/PayPal/Shippo
3. Add deployment guides for various platforms
4. Create troubleshooting section
5. Add real performance benchmarks

### Long Term (Low Priority)
1. Video tutorials for complex workflows
2. Community contribution guidelines
3. Plugin development documentation
4. Advanced customization guides
5. Migration tools from other platforms

## Content Creation Guidelines

### Use Steps Component
All workflow documentation must use the official Steps component:
```jsx
import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Steps>
<Step>
### Step Title
Step content...
</Step>
</Steps>
```

### Code Examples
Include real examples from the platform:
```typescript
// GraphQL mutation example
const order = await context.query.Order.createOne({
  data: {
    email: "customer@example.com",
    displayId: 1001,
    status: "pending",
    lineItems: {
      create: lineItemsData
    }
  }
});
```

### Integration Examples
Show actual adapter patterns:
```typescript
// Payment provider integration
const paymentResult = await paymentProviderAdapter.createPaymentFunction({
  cart,
  amount: cart.total,
  currency: cart.currency.code
});
```

## AI Assistant Instructions

When working on OpenFront documentation:

1. **Read Platform Documentation**: Always reference the PLATFORM.md file for accurate technical details
2. **Verify Implementation**: Check actual code in `/Users/junaid/openfront-final2/` rather than making assumptions
3. **Use Steps Components**: Replace numbered lists with proper Steps components
4. **Focus on Real Features**: Document implemented capabilities, not planned features
5. **Include Examples**: Provide working GraphQL queries, mutations, and integration code
6. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow existing documentation patterns and styling

## Important Notes

- OpenFront Final 2 has significantly more features than currently documented
- The platform includes enterprise-level capabilities often not found in basic e-commerce solutions
- Payment and shipping systems use sophisticated adapter patterns for flexibility
- Analytics, claims, and gift card systems are fully implemented but undocumented
- Multi-regional commerce is production-ready with currency and tax support

## Conclusion

OpenFront is a robust, production-ready e-commerce platform with comprehensive features already implemented. The focus should be on accurately documenting existing capabilities and providing clear guidance for developers and businesses to successfully deploy and customize the platform.

The platform offers a genuine alternative to Shopify with modern technology, full customization capabilities, and no vendor lock-in, backed by a solid implementation that's ready for real-world use.
