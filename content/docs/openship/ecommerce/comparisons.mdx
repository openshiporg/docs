## Traditional Order Management Systems

Openship is designed to be a lightweight, flexible alternative to heavy enterprise OMS solutions. Most traditional systems are expensive, difficult to customize, and require significant implementation time.

Openship works great if you want more control over your order routing logic, such as adding custom rules, integrating with unique fulfillment partners, or building on top of an existing codebase.

## Shopify Flow / Order Routing Apps

Many Shopify apps provide basic order routing functionality, but they're limited to the Shopify ecosystem and often lack flexibility.

Openship is platform-agnostic and can work with any e-commerce platform or custom system. It's designed for businesses that sell across multiple channels and need sophisticated routing logic.

## Custom Built Solutions

Building your own order management system from scratch takes significant time and resources. Openship provides the foundation so you can focus on your unique business logic rather than reinventing basic functionality.
