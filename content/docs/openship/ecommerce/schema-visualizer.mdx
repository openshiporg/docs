## Understanding the Schema

The Openship database is built using Prisma with PostgreSQL and consists of several core model groups:

### User Management
- **User** - The central user model with role-based permissions
- **Role** - Defines what actions users can perform
- **ApiKey** - API access tokens for programmatic access

### Platform Architecture
- **ShopPlatform** - Templates for shop integrations (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce)
- **ChannelPlatform** - Templates for channel integrations (e.g., suppliers, 3PLs)
- **Shop** - Individual shop instances using platform templates
- **Channel** - Individual channel instances using platform templates

### Order Management
- **Order** - Customer orders from shops
- **LineItem** - Individual items within orders
- **CartItem** - Items being purchased from channels
- **TrackingDetail** - Shipping and fulfillment tracking

### Product Matching
- **ShopItem** - Products available from shops
- **ChannelItem** - Products available from channels  
- **Match** - Connections between shop and channel products
- **Link** - Automated routing rules between shops and channels

## Key Relationships

The schema shows how Openship creates a bridge between e-commerce platforms:

1. **Platform → Instance**: Platforms define how to integrate, while Shops/Channels are configured instances
2. **Order Flow**: Orders → LineItems → CartItems (automated purchasing)
3. **Product Matching**: ShopItems ↔ Matches ↔ ChannelItems (product mapping)
4. **Fulfillment**: CartItems → TrackingDetails (shipping updates)

This architecture allows Openship to automatically route orders from any connected shop to any connected channel based on your configured matches and links.
