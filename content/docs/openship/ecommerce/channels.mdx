Openship uses a two-tier system for connecting to fulfillment providers: **Channel Platforms** (templates) and **Channels** (instances). Understanding this distinction is crucial for setting up your fulfillment network correctly.

## Channel Platforms vs Channels

### Channel Platforms (Templates)

A **Channel Platform** is a reusable template that defines how Openship integrates with a specific type of fulfillment provider. Think of it as a blueprint or configuration preset for purchase and fulfillment operations.

**What Channel Platforms contain:**
- Integration function mappings (which code to run for different operations)
- OAuth credentials for app-based installations
- Default settings for the fulfillment provider type

**Examples of Channel Platforms:**
- **Shopify Platform** - Template for purchasing from Shopify stores
- **3PL Platform** - Template for warehouse/3PL providers
- **Supplier Platform** - Template for direct supplier integrations
- **Demo Platform** - Template for testing custom fulfillment integrations
- **Custom Platform** - Template with HTTP endpoints for custom fulfillment systems

### Channels (Instances)

A **Channel** is an actual connection to a specific fulfillment provider or supplier account. It uses a Channel Platform template but contains the unique credentials and settings for that particular provider.

**What Channels contain:**
- Reference to which Channel Platform to use
- Provider-specific credentials (domain, access token, API keys)
- Channel name and metadata
- Custom configuration overrides

**Examples of Channels:**
- **"Main Supplier"** - Uses Shopify Platform, connects to `supplier.myshopify.com`
- **"3PL Warehouse"** - Uses 3PL Platform, connects to warehouse API
- **"Demo Channel"** - Uses Demo Platform for testing

## How Channels Work

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create Channel Platform (Template)

First, you create a Channel Platform that defines the fulfillment integration method:

```
Channel Platform: "Shopify Fulfillment Platform"
├── searchProductsFunction: "shopify"
├── getProductFunction: "shopify"
├── createPurchaseFunction: "shopify"
├── createWebhookFunction: "shopify"
└── createTrackingWebhookHandler: "shopify"
```

All function values point to the built-in Shopify channel integration (`/integrations/channel/shopify.ts`).

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Channels (Instances)

Then, you create individual channels that use this platform:

```
Channel: "Supplier A"               Channel: "Supplier B"
├── Platform: Shopify Platform      ├── Platform: Shopify Platform  
├── Domain: supplier-a.myshopify.com├── Domain: supplier-b.myshopify.com
├── Access Token: abc123...         ├── Access Token: xyz789...
└── Name: "Supplier A"              └── Name: "Supplier B"
```

Both channels use the same integration logic (Shopify Platform) but connect to different suppliers with different credentials.

</Step>
<Step>

### Function Execution

When Openship needs to create a purchase in "Supplier A":

1. **Lookup**: Find channel's platform → "Shopify Platform"
2. **Check function**: `createPurchaseFunction` = "shopify" 
3. **Import**: Load `/integrations/channel/shopify.ts`
4. **Execute**: Call `createPurchaseFunction()` with channel's credentials
5. **Connect**: Make API calls to `supplier-a.myshopify.com` to create purchase order

</Step>
</Steps>

## Platform Types

### Built-in Platform Presets

Openship comes with preset templates for popular fulfillment platforms:

- **Shopify** - Purchase from Shopify stores (dropshipping suppliers)
- **BigCommerce** - Purchase from BigCommerce stores
- **WooCommerce** - Purchase from WordPress/WooCommerce suppliers
- **Demo** - Testing platform with sample fulfillment data

When you select a preset, all function values are automatically filled with the appropriate integration name.

### Custom HTTP Platforms

You can also create platforms that use HTTP endpoints instead of built-in integrations:

```
Channel Platform: "My 3PL Platform"
├── searchProductsFunction: "https://my-3pl.com/api/search-products"
├── getProductFunction: "https://my-3pl.com/api/get-product"
├── createPurchaseFunction: "https://my-3pl.com/api/create-purchase"
└── createWebhookFunction: "https://my-3pl.com/api/create-webhook"
```

This allows integration with any fulfillment system that can provide HTTP endpoints matching Openship's interface.

## Channel Operations

### Product Search and Selection

Channels provide products that can be purchased for fulfillment:

- **Search Products** - Browse available inventory from the fulfillment provider
- **Get Product Details** - Retrieve pricing, availability, and specifications
- **Match Products** - Link shop products to channel products for automated purchasing

### Purchase Creation

When orders come in from shops, channels handle purchase fulfillment:

- **Create Purchase Orders** - Automatically place orders with suppliers/3PLs
- **Handle Special Requirements** - Custom logic for different product types
- **Generate Invoices** - Create purchase documentation

### Tracking and Updates

Channels provide real-time fulfillment updates:

- **Webhook Handlers** - Receive shipping notifications from providers
- **Tracking Updates** - Forward tracking information to customers
- **Status Changes** - Handle cancellations and modifications

## Typical Workflow

### Step 1: Create Channel Platform

1. Go to **Channel Platforms** page
2. Click **"Create Platform"**
3. Choose a preset (Shopify, 3PL, etc.) or create custom
4. Configure OAuth credentials (if needed)
5. Save the platform template

### Step 2: Create Channels

1. Go to **Channels** page  
2. Select your Channel Platform
3. Click **"Create Channel"**
4. Enter channel-specific details:
   - Channel name
   - Provider domain/endpoint
   - Access credentials
5. Save the channel instance

### Step 3: Product Matching

1. Go to **Matches** page
2. **Select shop products** to fulfill
3. **Search channel products** for fulfillment options
4. **Create matches** linking shop products to channel products

### Step 4: Automation

Now your channels can automatically:
- **Receive orders** from matched shop products
- **Create purchases** with the fulfillment provider
- **Update tracking** when items ship
- **Handle cancellations** and modifications

## Benefits of This System

### Reusability
Create one Shopify channel platform, use it for multiple suppliers without reconfiguring integration settings.

### Flexibility  
Mix built-in integrations with custom HTTP endpoints. Use Shopify for some suppliers, custom APIs for 3PLs.

### Maintainability
Update integration logic in the platform template, and all channels using that platform inherit the changes.

### Testing
Use demo platforms for testing fulfillment workflows without affecting real suppliers.

### Scalability
Easily add new fulfillment providers by creating new channel platforms and instances.

## Getting Started

### For Built-in Platforms
1. **Create** a platform using a preset (e.g., "Shopify Platform")
2. **Connect** channels to that platform with supplier credentials
3. **Start** matching products and enabling automation

### For Custom Integrations
1. **Deploy** HTTP endpoints following our [custom channel guide](/docs/how-to-guides/create-custom-channel)
2. **Create** a custom platform pointing to your endpoints  
3. **Connect** channels using your custom platform
4. **Test** the integration with our demo endpoints first

### For Testing
1. **Create** a "Demo Platform" using the demo preset
2. **Add** demo channels with sample test data
3. **Practice** workflows before connecting real suppliers

### Working with 3PLs
1. **Understand** your 3PL's API capabilities
2. **Create** custom HTTP platform matching their interface
3. **Set up** webhook endpoints for tracking updates
4. **Test** purchase creation and tracking flows

### Dropshipping Setup
1. **Use** Shopify platform for supplier stores
2. **Create** channels for each supplier
3. **Match** your shop products to supplier products
4. **Enable** automatic purchase creation

The channel platform system gives you maximum flexibility in building your fulfillment network. Whether you're working with a single supplier or managing complex 3PL relationships, the platform-first approach scales with your business needs.
