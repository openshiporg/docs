## Introduction

Openship is an **order routing platform** that connects the places where you're selling to the places where you're fulfilling. It automatically routes orders from your sales channels to your fulfillment partners, giving you complete control over your order flow.

## Automatic Installation

A minimum version of Node.js 20 required.

```bash tab="npm"
git clone https://github.com/openship-org/openship.git
cd openship
npm install
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
git clone https://github.com/openship-org/openship.git
cd openship
pnpm install
```

```bash tab="yarn"
git clone https://github.com/openship-org/openship.git
cd openship
yarn install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Required: Change this to a secure random string
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-here

# Required: Your PostgreSQL database connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/openship

# Optional: SMTP configuration for email notifications
SMTP_FROM="no-reply@yourdomain.com"
SMTP_HOST="your-smtp-host"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your-smtp-password"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-smtp-user"
```

### Start Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
