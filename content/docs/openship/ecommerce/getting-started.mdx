## Introduction

Openfront is an **order routing platform** that connects the places where you're selling to the places where you're fulfilling. It automatically routes orders from your sales channels to your fulfillment partners, giving you complete control over your order flow.

## Automatic Installation

A minimum version of Node.js 20 required.
