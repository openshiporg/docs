Openship has 4 main sections for managing order routing between your shops and fulfillment providers. Built with Next.js 15 and KeystoneJS 6, it gives you a clean interface for connecting everything together.

<Callout type="info">
**Order Routing Platform**: Openship is NOT an e-commerce platform. It's an order routing platform that connects shops (where you sell) to channels (where you fulfill).
</Callout>

## Platform Sections

## How Openship Works

### Order Flow
1. **Orders arrive** from connected shops (Shopify, Openfront, etc.)
2. **Openship routes orders** to appropriate channels based on matches
3. **Channels fulfill orders** and provide tracking information
4. **Updates flow back** to original shops automatically

### Two-Tier Architecture
Openship uses a platform-instance architecture:

- **Platforms** define integration templates (ShopPlatform, ChannelPlatform)
- **Instances** are actual connections using platform templates (Shop, Channel)

This lets you reuse integration logic across multiple connections of the same type.

## Key Capabilities

### Automated Order Routing

- Automatic order forwarding based on product matches
- Flexible routing rules and conditions
- Real-time order status updates

### Integration Management

- Channel adapters for different fulfillment providers
- Webhook processing for real-time updates
- API integrations for smooth data flow

### Product Matching
- Map shop products to channel products
- Support for multiple fulfillment options per product
- Easy vendor switching without disruption
- Automatic inventory sync

## Data Models

Openship uses 15 core data models for order routing:

**User & Auth:** User, Role, ApiKey
**Platforms:** ShopPlatform, ChannelPlatform  
**Instances:** Shop, Channel
**Orders:** Order, LineItem, CartItem
**Products:** ShopItem, ChannelItem, Match
**Routing:** Link, TrackingDetail

## Getting Started

2. **Connect shops** where you receive orders
3. **Connect channels** where you fulfill orders  
4. **Create product matches** between shop and channel products
