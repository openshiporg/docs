Openship uses a two-tier system for connecting to e-commerce platforms: **Shop Platforms** (templates) and **Shops** (instances). Understanding this distinction is crucial for setting up your integrations correctly.

## Shop Platforms vs Shops

### Shop Platforms (Templates)

A **Shop Platform** is a reusable template that defines how Openship integrates with a specific type of e-commerce platform. Think of it as a blueprint or configuration preset.

**What Shop Platforms contain:**
- Integration function mappings (which code to run for different operations)
- OAuth credentials for app-based installations
- Default settings for the platform type

**Examples of Shop Platforms:**
- **Shopify Platform** - Template for all Shopify stores
- **BigCommerce Platform** - Template for all BigCommerce stores  
- **Demo Platform** - Template for testing custom integrations
- **Custom Platform** - Template with HTTP endpoints for custom integrations

### Shops (Instances)

A **Shop** is an actual connection to a specific store or account. It uses a Shop Platform template but contains the unique credentials and settings for that particular store.

**What Shops contain:**
- Reference to which Shop Platform to use
- Store-specific credentials (domain, access token)
- Store name and metadata
- Custom configuration overrides

**Examples of Shops:**
- **"My Shopify Store"** - Uses Shopify Platform, connects to `mystore.myshopify.com`
- **"Backup Store"** - Also uses Shopify Platform, connects to `backup.myshopify.com`
- **"Demo Shop"** - Uses Demo Platform for testing

## How Shops Work

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create Shop Platform (Template)

First, you create a Shop Platform that defines the integration method:

```
Shop Platform: "Shopify Platform"
├── searchProductsFunction: "shopify"
├── getProductFunction: "shopify"
├── searchOrdersFunction: "shopify"
├── updateProductFunction: "shopify"
└── createWebhookFunction: "shopify"
```

All function values point to the built-in Shopify integration (`/integrations/shop/shopify.ts`).

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Shops (Instances)

Then, you create individual shops that use this platform:

```
Shop: "Main Store"                Shop: "EU Store"
├── Platform: Shopify Platform    ├── Platform: Shopify Platform  
├── Domain: main.myshopify.com    ├── Domain: eu.myshopify.com
├── Access Token: abc123...       ├── Access Token: xyz789...
└── Name: "Main Store"            └── Name: "EU Store"
```

Both shops use the same integration logic (Shopify Platform) but connect to different stores with different credentials.

</Step>
<Step>

### Function Execution

When Openship needs to search products in "Main Store":

1. **Lookup**: Find shop's platform → "Shopify Platform"
2. **Check function**: `searchProductsFunction` = "shopify" 
3. **Import**: Load `/integrations/shop/shopify.ts`
4. **Execute**: Call `searchProductsFunction()` with shop's credentials
5. **Connect**: Make API calls to `main.myshopify.com` using shop's access token

</Step>
</Steps>

## Platform Types

### Built-in Platform Presets

Openship comes with preset templates for popular e-commerce platforms:

- **Shopify** - Full integration with Shopify stores
- **BigCommerce** - Full integration with BigCommerce stores  
- **WooCommerce** - WordPress/WooCommerce integration
- **Demo** - Testing platform with sample data

When you select a preset, all function values are automatically filled with the appropriate integration name.

### Custom HTTP Platforms

You can also create platforms that use HTTP endpoints instead of built-in integrations:

```
Shop Platform: "My Custom Platform"
├── searchProductsFunction: "https://my-api.com/search-products"
├── getProductFunction: "https://my-api.com/get-product"
├── searchOrdersFunction: "https://my-api.com/search-orders"
└── updateProductFunction: "https://my-api.com/update-product"
```

This allows integration with any system that can provide HTTP endpoints matching Openship's interface.

## Typical Workflow

### Step 1: Create Shop Platform

1. Go to **Shop Platforms** page
2. Click **"Create Platform"**
3. Choose a preset (Shopify, BigCommerce, etc.) or create custom
4. Configure OAuth credentials (if needed)
5. Save the platform template

### Step 2: Create Shops

1. Go to **Shops** page  
2. Select your Shop Platform
3. Click **"Create Shop"**
4. Enter shop-specific details:
   - Shop name
   - Store domain
   - Access credentials
5. Save the shop instance

### Step 3: Use in Automation

Now your shops can be used in:
- **Product matching** - Link products between shops and channels
- **Order automation** - Automatic order processing
- **Inventory sync** - Keep stock levels synchronized

## Benefits of This System

### Reusability
Create one Shopify platform, use it for multiple Shopify stores without reconfiguring integration settings.

### Flexibility  
Mix built-in integrations with custom HTTP endpoints. Use Shopify for some shops, custom APIs for others.

### Maintainability
Update integration logic in the platform template, and all shops using that platform inherit the changes.

### Testing
Use demo platforms for testing automation workflows without affecting real stores.

## Getting Started

### For Built-in Platforms
1. **Create** a platform using a preset (e.g., "Shopify Platform")
2. **Connect** shops to that platform with their specific credentials
3. **Start** creating product matches and automation

### For Custom Integrations
1. **Deploy** HTTP endpoints following our [custom shop guide](/docs/how-to-guides/create-custom-shop)
2. **Create** a custom platform pointing to your endpoints  
3. **Connect** shops using your custom platform
4. **Test** the integration with our demo endpoints first

### For Testing
1. **Create** a "Demo Platform" using the demo preset
2. **Add** demo shops with sample test data
3. **Practice** workflows before connecting real stores

The platform system gives you maximum flexibility while maintaining consistency across your integrations. Whether you're connecting a single Shopify store or building complex custom integrations, the platform-first approach scales with your needs.
