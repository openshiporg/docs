## Traditional E-commerce Platforms

Openfront is designed to be a flexible, customizable alternative to existing e-commerce platforms. Most traditional platforms are either too restrictive or overly complex for businesses that need specific functionality.

Openfront works great if you want complete control over your e-commerce experience, need custom integrations, or want to build on top of an existing codebase without platform limitations.
