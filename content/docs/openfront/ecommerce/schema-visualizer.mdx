## Key Relationships

The schema shows how Openfront provides a complete e-commerce platform:

1. **Store Structure**: Store → Products → Variants (product catalog)
2. **Order Flow**: Cart → Order → Fulfillment → Shipping (order processing)
3. **Payment**: PaymentSession → Payment → Capture/Refund (payment processing)
4. **Customer Journey**: User → Cart → Order → Return (customer lifecycle)
5. **Inventory**: ProductVariant → StockMovement → Location (inventory management)

This architecture allows Openfront to handle complex e-commerce scenarios with multi-currency, multi-region support, advanced pricing rules, and comprehensive order management.
