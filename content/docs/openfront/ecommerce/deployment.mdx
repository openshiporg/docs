## Getting started

Openfront runs on Next.js, so you can host it anywhere that supports Node.js. You'll also need a `postgres` database.

## 1-Click Deployment

These platforms include `Node.js` and `postgres` databases for 1-click deployment.

### Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/openshiporg/openfront)

For platforms like [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) that don't include databases, you'll need to add a `postgres` connection string as the `DATABASE_URL` variable.

Go to site settings > build & deploy > environment and add these variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:example@url:3000/postgres
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-session-secret-key
```

Replace DATABASE_URL with a postgres database connection string. Redeploy the site.
