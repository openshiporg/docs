# GraphQL Playground

Each Openfront instance has a GraphQL Playground at `/api/graphql`. Use it to get the API reference, interact with the API, and build integrations.

For testing, use the development instance playground: https://demo.openfront.com/api/graphql

## Accessing the API

On the dashboard, generate an API key on the sidebar. Pass the key as a header named `x-api-key` for all API calls.
