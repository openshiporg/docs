# Openship

## Introduction

Openship is an open-source fulfillment platform that enables e-commerce companies to create and leverage multi-channel fulfillment.

## Basic concepts

### Shops

Shops represent your online stores where your customers place orders (e.g. Shopify, WooCommerce, eBay, Amazon). Once connected, new orders can be routed to Openship to be fulfilled.

### Channels

Channels represent destinations where your orders can be routed and fulfilled. A channel could be an existing platform like your supplier's Shopify shop or a 3PL solution like FBA or ShipBob. It could also be something very simple like adding a row to a Google Sheet or sending an email with the order details. Openship currently only supports Shopify out of the box, but custom channels can be created. Check out [this guide](/how-to-guides/create-custom-channel) to learn more.

### Links

Links represent a connection between a shop and a channel. Once linked, new shop orders are forwarded to the linked channel for fulfillment.

### Matches

For finer control over the fulfillment process, matches can be created on the product level. Matches represent a connection between your shop products and your channel products. When a match is created between a shop product and channel product, Openship will automatically process that order. Matches can be easily changed between your channel products so you are not locked-in to any one vendor, supplier, or fulfillment system as you scale.
